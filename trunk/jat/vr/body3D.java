/* This file is the result of numerous attempts to rename body3D.java to Body3D.java 
 * and convince CVS to accept it. For now, I put the code into ABody3D.java
 * and am waiting until we do a completely new install of the repository, then I'll
 * rename ABody3D.java to Body3D.java.
 * Beware of CVS when you choose your file names! Changing the capitalization of a file name
 * seems to be a problem.
