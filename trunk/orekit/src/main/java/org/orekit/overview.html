<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p> 
  OREKIT library is a low level library for space mechanics projects. It is 
implemented in the JAVA language. 
</p>
<p>OREKIT project was initiated by CS with the following goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
 <li>provide a common base layer for space projects</li>
 <li>support both quick developments with loose requirements and complex
     projects with rich physical modeling, fine customization, and high accuracy</li>
 <li>be user-extensible through clear and as simple as possible architecture</li> 
 <li>use unified interfaces to allow models and algorithms switching with almost no effort</li>
 <li>provide both basic and rich models that can be plugged interchangeably to ease
     applications validation</li> 
 <li>separate models configuration from models usage to hide away complexity and keep
     caller code simple</li>
 <li>support both development of standalone and embedded applications (web services,
     plugins, scripting frameworks ...)</li>
 <li>use up-to-date techniques for low cost development and maintenance</li>
 <li>remove platforms and system dependencies and leverage environment-hell
     (environment variables, dynamic libraries versions, operating system,
      filesystem layout ...)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Features</h2>
<p>
Orekit can be used for many purposes, from simple geometrical or orbital tools 
up to complex orbits propagators with several perturbing forces, maneuvers and
discrete events. Here is a short list of the features offered by the library:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time

      <li>numerical propagators
        <ul>
          <li>customizable force models
            <ul>

              <li>atmospheric drag (DTM2000, Jacchia-Bowman 2006 and simple exponential models)</li>
              <li>third body attraction</li>
              <li>radiation pressure with eclipses</li>

          <li>state of the art ODE integrators (adaptive stepsize with error control,
              continuous output, switching functions, G-stop, step normalization ...)</li>
          <li>can be used in master mode (program drives integration), slave mode (integrator
              drives program) or unattended mode (all intermediate results solved and
              navigation feature enabled, to use the model as if it was an analytical model,
              ideal for search and iterative algorithms)</li>
          <li>serialization mechanism to store complete results on persistent storage for later use</li>

<h2>3. Dependency</h2>
<p>
OREKIT has only one dependency: the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/math/">commons-math</a>
open-source library. This library provides mathematical tools for many purposes: geometry,
polynomial equations, differential equations, and more... It is distributed under the
business-friendly Apache Software License version 2.0.
</p>
<p>
OREKIT is based on two commons-math packages:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>{@link org.apache.commons.math.geometry}, which provides very useful objects as vectors
   and rotations (internally represented by quaternions)</li>
 <li>{@link org.apache.commons.math.ode}, which provides numerical solutions to solve 
   Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The use of commons-math is hidden in OREKIT as much as possible so users don't 
need to fully master this library. If they wish, they can limit themselves to understanding
the simple classes {@link org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D} and
{@link org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Rotation}, and the interface
{@link org.apache.commons.math.ode.FirstOrderIntegrator}.
