This package provides classes to handle frames and transforms between them.
	
<p>
The {@link org.orekit.frames.Transform} class represents a full
transform: combined rotation and translation, and their first time derivatives to 
handle kinematics. 
</p>

<p> 
Each {@link org.orekit.frames.Frame} is defined by a transform linking it to 
another one, called its parent frame. The only exception is the predefined  J2000 inertial
frame which has no parent. This implies that all frames are naturally organized as a tree
with a single root: the J2000 frame.
<p>

<p>
Several other frames are predefined. One set correspond to the frames from the IERS 2003
conventions (ITRF2000 and others). Both complete 2000A and reduced 2000B versions are
available. Another frame not belonging to the previous set is the Veis 1950 frame which is
considered here as a simple rotation from J2000.
<p>

<p> 
The frames can be time dependent (for example the ITRF2000A frame depends on time due to
precession/nutation, Earth rotation and pole motion). In order to get a transform from one
frame to another one, the date must be specified, and
{@link org.orekit.frames.Frame#updateFrame(AbsoluteDate)} is called under the hood. If a
user wants to implement his own date synchronized frame, he has to 
implement by extension his own {@link org.orekit.frames.Frame#updateFrame(AbsoluteDate)}
method, the default implementation provided by the base class does nothing and is suited
for non time dependent frames.
