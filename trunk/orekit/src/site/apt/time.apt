Time

  The "Time" package is an independent package providing classes to handle epochs, 
  time scales, and to compare instants between them.
	
* Time Presentation

  The principal class is <AbsoluteDate> which represents a unique instant in time, 
  with no ambiguity. For that purpose, the ways to define this object are quite strict.


** Instant "relative" definition

  The easiest and most evident way is to define an instant with an offset from another
  one. Orekit defines 6 reference epochs. The first 5 are commonly used in the space
  community and the last one is commonly used in the computer science field.

      ** <Julian Epoch>: -4712-01-01 at 12:00:00, TTScale
      
      ** <Modified Julian Epoch>: 1858-11-17 at 00:00:00, TTScale
      
      ** <Fifties Epoch>: 1950-01-01 at 00:00:00,  TTScale
      
      ** <GPS Epoch>: 1980-01-06 at 00:00:00,  UTCScale

      ** <J2000 Epoch>: 2000-01-01 at 12:00:00, TTScale

      ** <Java Epoch>: 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00, TTScale
  	  

** Instant "absolute" definition

  The second definition, that can be the source of some confusion, is by giving a 
  location (a date) in a specific <time scale>. It is of prime importance to understand 
  the various available time scales definitions to avoid mistakes. Orekit provides 
  4 of the most important ones:

    ** <<International Atomic Time>>,
    

    ** <<Terrestrial Time>> as defined by IAU(1991)
	recommendation IV. Coordinate time at the surface of the Earth. It is the
	successor of Ephemeris Time TE. By convention, TT = TAI + 32.184 s,
	    

    ** <<Coordinated Universal Time>>. UTC is related to
    TAI using step adjustments from time to time according to IERS (International Earth
    Rotation Service) rules. These adjustments require introduction of leap seconds,


    ** <<Geocentric Coordinate Time>>. Coordinate time at the
    center of mass of the Earth. This time scale depends linearly from TTScale.
        

  An instant can be defined by a chunked date, or by its coordinates on the time scale
  (expressed as a number of seconds from the time scale origin).       
 
 
* Time Use

  Once it is built, an <AbsoluteDate> can be compared to other ones, and converted 
  and expressed in other time scales. 
  It is used to define states, orbits, frames...
