Orekit can be built from source either using maven 2,
ant or eclipse (with the m2eclipse plugin).

Building with Maven 2:
 - Maven 2 can be downloaded here:
       http://maven.apache.org/download.html
 - running "mvn package" automatically downloads all
   the required dependencies listed in the pom.xml file
   and creates a file named target/orekit-x.y.jar where
   x.y is the version number

Building with Ant:
 - Ant can be downloaded here:
       http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
 - edit the automatically generated build.xml file to
   handle dependencies as they are available in your
   system (the generated file tries to mimic maven
   behaviour and download them, which may not be what
   you want)
 - running "ant jar" creates a file named
   target/orekit-x.y.jar where x.y is the version number

Building with Eclipse:
 - Eclipse can be downloaded here:
       http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
 - open orekit as a java project (the eclipse .project
   is already provided with the orekit source distribution)
 - configure the dependencies in the build path as they
   are available in your system (the .classpath file
   is configured to use a maven 2 repository, which may
   not be what you want)
 - build the project as usual using eclipse features
