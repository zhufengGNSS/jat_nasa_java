This independent package provides classes to handle epochs, time scales, and to compare 
instants between them.
	
<p> The principal class is {@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate}
which represents a unique instant in time, with no ambiguity. For that
purpose, the ways to define this object are quite strict.</p>

<p>The easiest and most evident way is to define an instant with an offset from another
 one. Orekit defines 6 reference epochs. The first 5 are commonly used in the space
 community and the last one is commonly used in the computer science field.
 <ul>
  	  <li>{@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate#JULIAN_EPOCH Julian Epoch}: -4712-01-01 at 12:00:00, TTScale</li>
      <li>{@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate#MODIFIED_JULIAN_EPOCH Modified Julian Epoch}: 1858-11-17 at 00:00:00, TTScale</li>
      <li>{@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate#FIFTIES_EPOCH Fifties Epoch}: 1950-01-01 at 00:00:00,  TTScale</li>
      <li>{@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate#GPS_EPOCH GPS Epoch}: 1980-01-06 at 00:00:00,  UTCScale</li>
      <li>{@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate#J2000_EPOCH J2000 Epoch}: 2000-01-01 at 12:00:00, TTScale</li>
      <li>{@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate#JAVA_EPOCH Java Epoch}: 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00. TTScale</li>
 </ul> 
</p>

<p>The second definition, that can be the source of some confusion, is by giving a location
 (a date) in a specific <em>time scale</em>. It is of prime importance to understand the
 various available time scales definitions to avoid mistakes. Orekit provides 4 of the most
 important ones:
 <ul>
    <li>{@link org.orekit.time.TAIScale}: International Atomic Time,</li>
    <li>{@link org.orekit.time.TTScale}: Terrestrial Time as defined by IAU(1991)
	    recommendation IV. Coordinate time at the surface of the Earth. It is the
	    successor of Ephemeris Time TE. By convention, TT = TAI + 32.184 s,</li>
    <li>{@link org.orekit.time.UTCScale}: Coordinated Universal Time. UTC is related to
        TAI using step adjustments from time to time according to IERS (International Earth
        Rotation Service) rules. These adjustments require introduction of leap seconds,</li>
    <li>{@link org.orekit.time.TCGScale}: Geocentric Coordinate Time. Coordinate time at the
        center of mass of the Earth. This time scale depends linearly from TTScale.</li>
 </ul> 
</p>
 
<p>Once it is built, an {@link org.orekit.time.AbsoluteDate} can be compared 
to other ones, and expressed in other time scales. It is used to define states, orbits,
frames...</p>
