/** This interface represents a force modifying spacecraft motion.

 * Objects implementing this interface are intended to be added to a
 * {@link org.orekit.propagation.numerical.NumericalPropagator numerical propagator}
 * before the propagation is started.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The propagator will call at each step the {@link #addContribution(SpacecraftState,
 * TimeDerivativesEquations)} method. The force model instance will extract all the
 * state data it needs (date,position, velocity, frame, attitude, mass) from the first
 * parameter. From these state data, it will compute the perturbing acceleration. It
 * will then add this acceleration to the second parameter which will take thins
 * contribution into account and will use the Gauss equations to evaluate its impact
 * on the global state derivative.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Force models which create discontinuous acceleration patterns (typically for maneuvers
 * start/stop or solar eclipses entry/exit) must provide one or more {@link
 * org.orekit.propagation.events.EventDetector events detectors} to the
 * propagator thanks to their {@link #getEventsDetectors()} method. This method
 * is called once just before propagation starts. The events states will be checked by
 * the propagator to ensure accurate propagation and proper events handling.
