      <question>
        When I try to compile orekit, maven cannot find commons-math 2.0-SNAPSHOT, where is it ?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Orekit depends on features of commons which have not been released as of early 2008.
          You will have to retrieve the development version from Apache subversion repository,
          located in the MATH_2_0 branch and compile it yourself. This is done by the following
          three commands on a Unix or GNU/Linux system:
        </p>
        <pre>
svn checkout \
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/branches/MATH_2_0 \
    commons-math
cd commons-math
mvn install
        </pre>
        <p>
          You will have to adjust these commands for other systems or if you use a graphical
          interface to subversion.
