Building Orekit

  Orekit can be built from source using several different tools.
  
  All these tools are Java based and can run on many different operating
  systems, including Unix, GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Some GNU/Linux
  distributions provide these tools in their packages repositories (for
  exemple Debian Lenny provides all of them but Debian Etch does not
  provide maven 2).

* Building with Maven 2

  {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven}} is a build tool that goes far beyond
  simply compiling and packaging a product. It is also able to resolve
  dependencies (including downloading the appropriate versions from the public
  repositories), to run automated tests, to launch various checking tools and
  to create a web site for a project. It runs on any platform supporting Java.
  
  For systems not providing maven as a package, maven can be downloaded
  from its site at the Apache Software Foundation:
  {{http://maven.apache.org/download.html}}, this page also explains the
  installation procedure.

  As all maven enabled projects, building Orekit is straigthforward, simply
  run:

+-------
mvn package
+-------

  The preceding command will perform all dependencies retrieval, compilation,
  tests and packaging for you. At the end, it will create a file named
  target/orekit-x.y.jar where x.y is the version number.

  If you need to configure a proxy server for dependencies retrieval, see
  the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html}Guide to using proxies}}
  page at the maven site.

  If you already use maven for your own projects (or simply eclipse, see
  below), you may want to install Orekit in your local repository. This is done
  with the following command:

+-------
mvn install
+-------

  For other commands like generating the site, or generating the
  {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}checkstyle}},
  {{{http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/}findbugs}} or
  {{{http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/}cobertura}} reports, see the maven
  plugins documentation at maven site:
  {{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html}}.

* Building with Ant

  {{{http://ant.apache.org/}Ant}} is another well known build tool. It is
  more ancient than maven and widely used. It does not provide as much
  features as maven (no site generation for example) but is very extensible.

  For systems not providing ant as a package, it can be downloaded from its
  site at the Apache Software Foundation: {{http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi}}.
  The installation procedure is explained in the
  {{{http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html}on-line manual}}.

  The build file for ant is in fact automatically generated when we create
  a release for Orekit. It uses a configuration that is based on the maven
  configuration and mimics maven behaviour.

  Compiling is done by running the command:

+-------
ant
+-------

  Just as maven does, this command also retrieve the dependencies from
  public repositories, compiles the sources and creates a file named
  target/orekit-x.y.jar where x.y is the version number.


  If you need to configure a proxy server for dependencies retrieval, see
  the {{{http://ant.apache.org/manual/proxy.html}Proxy Configuration}} page
  in the ant manual.

* Building with Eclipse

  {{{http://www.eclipse.org/}Eclipse}} is a very rich Integrated Development
  Environment (IDE). It is a huge product and not a simple build tool.

  For systems not providing eclipse as a package, it can be downloaded from its
  site at the Eclipse Foundation: {{http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/}}.

  The Orekit distribution already contains a .project and a .classpath files
  that can be used by Eclipse. So the simplest way to use Orekit with Eclipse
  is to unpack the distribution inside your Eclipse workspace and to create a
  new project from existing sources.

  There are chances that Eclipse will try to compile the project immediately after
  project creation and fail because of missing dependencies. This is due to the
  Java build path configuration already present in the .classpath file that
  probably won't match your local settings. It can be fixed by editing the
  Java build path configuration (select Build Path/Configure Build Path in the
  package explorer menu, and select the Libraries tab). You will see that
  the configuration uses a M2_REPO variable to point directly from Eclipse
  to the local maven 2 repository, this variable is used for both the junit test
  library and the commons-math mathematical library.
  
  If you also want to use both maven2 and eclipse, it is sufficient to set the
  M2_REPO variable to your own local repository (typically
  /home/your-username/.m2/repository on Unix, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X,
  and C:\Documents and Settings\username\.m2 on Windows). If you want to use
  Eclipse only, put the dependencies wherever you want and configure Eclipse
  accordingly, with or without a user variable.
