Forces

  The "Forces" package provides the interface for force models that will be used by the 
  <NumericalPropagator>.
  
* Forces presentation

  Objects implementing the force model interface are intended to be added to a
  numerical propagator before the propagation is started.
  
  The propagator will call at each step the force model contribution computation
  method, to be added to its time derivative equations. The force model instance 
  will extract all the state data it needs (date,position, velocity, frame, attitude, 
  mass) from the first parameter. 
  From these state data, it will compute the perturbing acceleration. It
  will then add this acceleration to the second parameter which will take thins
  contribution into account and will use the Gauss equations to evaluate its impact
  on the global state derivative.

  Force models which create discontinuous acceleration patterns (typically for maneuvers
  start/stop or solar eclipses entry/exit) must provide one or more events detectors to 
  the propagator thanks to their <getEventsDetectors()> method. This method
  is called once just before propagation starts. The events states will be checked by
  the propagator to ensure accurate propagation and proper events handling.


* Available force models

  The force models implemented are the following ones:

  * atmospheric drag forces,
  
  * gravity forces. Several attraction model are available for representing 
  the gravitational field of a celestial body: 
  
      ** Andrzej Droziner model (Institute of Mathematical Machines, Warsaw) in
          his 1976 paper: <An algorithm for recurrent calculation of gravitational
          acceleration> (artificial satellites, Vol. 12, No 2, June 1977),
      
      ** Leland E. Cunningham model (Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Sunnyvale
          and Astronomy Department University of California, Berkeley) in
          his 1969 paper: <On the computation of the spherical harmonic
          terms needed during the numerical integration of the orbital motion
          of an artificial satellite> (Celestial Mechanics 2, 1970),
  
  * forces induced by maneuvers. At present, only constant thrust maneuvers 
  are implemented, with the possibility to define an impulse maneuver, thanks 
  to the event detector mechanism.
  
  * solar radiation pressure force.
