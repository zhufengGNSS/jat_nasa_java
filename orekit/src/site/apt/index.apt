Overview

  OREKIT (ORbits Extrapolation KIT) is a free low level space dynamics library
  written in Java.

  It provides basic elements (orbits, dates, attitude, frames ...) and
  various algorithms to handle them (conversions, analytical and numerical
  propagation, pointing ...).

* Features

  ** Time

    * high accuracy absolute dates

    * time scales (TAI, UTC, GPS, TCG, TT ...)

    * transparent handling of leap seconds

  ** Geometry

    * frames hierarchy supporting fixed and time-dependent (or telemetry-dependent) frames

    * predefined frames (J2000, ITRF2000 (A and B) and intermediate frames, Veis, topocentric)

    * user extensible (used operationally in real time with a set of about 60 frames on
      several spacecrafts)

    * transparent handling of IERS Earth Orientation Parameters

    * transforms including kinematic combination effects

    * composite transforms reduction and caching for efficiency

    * extensible central body shapes models (with predefined spherical and ellipsoidic shapes)

    * cartesian and geodesic coordinates, kinematics

  ** Spacecraft state

    * cartesian, keplerian, circular and equinoctial parameters

    * Two-Lines Elements

    * transparent conversion between all parameters

    * automatic binding with frames

    * attitude state and derivative

    * mass management

  ** Propagation

    * analytical propagation models
      (Kepler, Eckstein-Heschler, SDP4/SGP4 with 2006 corrections)

    * numerical propagators

      * customizable force models

        * central attraction

        * gravity models
          (automatic reading of SHM (for Eigen models) and EGM formats potential files,
          even compressed)

        * atmospheric drag (DTM2000, Jacchia-Bowman 2006 and simple exponential models)

        * third body attraction

        * radiation pressure with eclipses

        * multiple maneuvers

      * state of the art ODE integrators (adaptive stepsize with error control,
        continuous output, switching functions, G-stop, step normalization ...)

      * serialization mechanism to store complete results on persistent storage for
        later use

    * tabulated ephemerides

      * file based

      * memory based

      * integration based

    * unified interface above analytical/numerical/tabulated propagators for easy
      switch from coarse analysis to fine simulation with one line change

    * all propagators can be used in several different modes

      * slave mode: propagator is driven by calling application

      * master mode: propagator drives application callback functions

      * ephemeris generation mode: all intermediate results are stored during
        propagation and provided back to the application which can navigate at will
        through them, effectively using the propagated orbit as if it was an
        analytical model, even if it really is a numerically propagated one, which
        is ideal for search and iterative algorithms

    * handling of discrete events during integration
      (models changes, G-stop, simple notifications ...)

    * predefined discrete events

      * ascending and descending node crossing

      * apogee and perigee crossing

      * elevation with respect to a topocentric frame (raising/setting)

      * date

      * impulse maneuvers

  ** Attitude

    * extensible attitude evolution models

    * predefined laws

      * central body related attitude
        (nadir pointing, center pointing, target pointing,
         yaw compensation, yaw-steering),

      * orbit referenced attitudes
        (LOF aligned, offset on all axes),

      * space referenced attitudes
        (inertial, celestial body pointed, spin stabilized)

* Free software

  Orekit is freely available both in source and binary formats, with all related
  documentation and tests.

  It is distributed under the {{{./license.html}Apache License Version 2.0}}. This
  is a well known business-friendly license. This means anybody can use it to build
  any application, free or not. There are no strings attached to your own code.

  Everybody is encouraged to use Orekit as a common low level layer to help
  interoperability in space systems.

* Maintained library

  Orekit has been in development since 2002 inside {{{http://uk.c-s.fr/}CS Communication
  & Syst\u00e8mes}} and is still used and maintained by its space dynamics experts.
  It has already been successfully used for operational space projects.
